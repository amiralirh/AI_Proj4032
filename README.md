# Project Summary
This project presents a machine learning solution for predicting diabetes based on a patient's medical data. The main goal is to build an accurate and reliable classification model that can serve as a supportive tool in the early diagnosis of diabetes. The project covers all stages, from data preprocessing to model comparison.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Addresses missing and illogical zero values using statistical techniques and scales features to optimize model performance.

- Multiple Model Implementation: Compares the performance of several powerful classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest.

- Comprehensive Evaluation: Evaluates models using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to determine the best performance.

# Results
In the model comparison, the Random Forest model was identified as the best choice for this dataset. It achieved the highest scores across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its high accuracy and stability.
